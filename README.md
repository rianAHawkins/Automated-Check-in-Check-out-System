# Automated-Check-in-Check-out-System
We are developing a state-of-the-art, automated system to manage equipment checkouts. This system will meticulously track the borrowing and returning of equipment. It will also maintain an inventory list for both of our material warehouses and an order sheet for each of the warehouses. The primary objective of this application is to foster awareness and accountability. Its features offer a degree of control that users and management can trust, ensuring the efficient tracking of supplies. It also holds individuals accountable for the equipment they use and are obliged to return. This system is designed to streamline operations and promote responsibility.
